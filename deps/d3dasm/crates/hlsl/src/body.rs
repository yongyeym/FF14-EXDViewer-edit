//! Expression recovery — the register traffic of a shader folded back into statements.
//!
//! Every instruction writes a register, so a line of the original source comes back as a run of
//! them. This walks the instruction stream keeping, for each component of each register, the value
//! that last landed there, and folds that value into whatever reads it next. A value read once, in
//! the same block, with nothing disturbing what it was computed from, disappears into its reader; a
//! value read twice, read from another block, or read after something it depends on was overwritten
//! is written down under the register's own name.
//!
//! The decision needs to know how a value gets used, which is only clear later, so the walk runs
//! more than once over the same bookkeeping, and no run can decide something an earlier one did not
//! see. It runs more than twice because the decisions feed each other: what a value depends on is
//! what its text names, and its text names a register wherever the value behind it stayed in one,
//! so which values move decides which are free to move. That is gone round until a reading comes
//! back describing itself. What the walks see also settles where a register stops carrying one
//! value and starts carrying the next, so each of those can take a name rather than sharing one.
