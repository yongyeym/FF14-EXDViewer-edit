//! Transform recovery — matrix multiplies and constructors, out of their unrolled pieces.
//!
//! Three things arrive here in pieces, since the machine has no instruction for a transform.
//! Sometimes it is one dot product per row of the result, each landing in its own component, and
//! sometimes it is each row of the matrix scaled by the component of the vector that picks it out,
//! summed in one expression. Either way, four of them against the same vector are the most
//! recognisable thing in a vertex shader, and saying so is the difference between reading a
//! transform and reading arithmetic. And a register filled a few components at a time is one value,
//! which a constructor says in a line.
//!
//! Rows are assembled with a constructor rather than by naming the matrix, except where the run
//! covers a declared matrix from its first row: a constructor takes its arguments in source order
//! whatever the packing, whereas naming the matrix means `mul` depends on how it was declared, and
//! picking wrong transposes the transform silently.
//!
//! Both read the same record of what each line assigns, the multiplies first, so that a transform
//! landing in three components can still join whatever fills the fourth.
