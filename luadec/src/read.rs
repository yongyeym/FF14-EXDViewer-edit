//! Two rules carry most of it. A register holds a temporary while the expression that produced it is
//! still being built, and was a local all along the moment something reads or overwrites it out of
//! stack order, because that is the only way a value outlives the statement that made it. And a jump
//! is read by where it lands rather than by what precedes it, so one conditional shape serves an
//! `if`, a `while` and the tail of a `repeat`.
