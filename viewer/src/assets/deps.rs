//! Assets a viewer needs beyond the file it was handed.
//!
//! A material names textures, a model names materials, and a `.uld` names both plus the sheet rows
//! its text comes from. Rendering any of them means fetching more files after the first decode has
//! already happened, so a viewer asks for a path and gets whatever is ready this frame, with the
//! fetch continuing in the background.
//!
//! Entries are kept in an LRU keyed by path, the same shape the sheet cache uses, so moving between
//! materials that share a texture does not refetch it.
