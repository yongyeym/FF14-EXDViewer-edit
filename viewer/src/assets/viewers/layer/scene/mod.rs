//! A zone's layers placed in space, flown through.
//!
//! Every `BgPart` is drawn at its own transform, and a `SharedGroup` is another file's tree read
//! under the transform that placed it. Composition is the ordinary one: a node's matrix is
//! translation times rotation times scale, the stored Euler triple turns about X first, then Y,
//! then Z, and a child is its parent's matrix times its own.
//!
//! Nothing is fetched up front. Files, models, materials and textures are asked for a few at a time
//! and nearest first, and the view draws whatever has arrived, so a zone fills in around the camera
//! rather than appearing at once. What is asked for at all is bounded by a load distance the user
//! sets: past it an instance is neither drawn nor fetched.
//!
//! The shading is deliberately not the game's. One key light, a hemisphere for whatever is turned
//! away from it, and the material's own diffuse map is all of it.
